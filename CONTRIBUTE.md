## Issues

### Labels

People feel comfortable with lists that have five to nine options to choose from
as this is the measured limit of chunks our short-term memory can handle at once.
To support you writing good issues we choose at most five labels:

- **bug** - as simple as that.
  Something went wrong, data loss or other mistakes that the software makes.
- **question** - get support here.
  Yes, we do even answer questions via issues if you mark them with this label ;)
- **enhancement** - something brilliant and new.
  If you have an idea about some new features this is your label.

This is a small set that supports a quick overview and is easy to understand,
thanks to it's sharp distinction.
