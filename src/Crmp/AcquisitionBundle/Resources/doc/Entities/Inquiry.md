# Inquiries


When a customer comes into your rooms or sends you a mail,
then every one in your business likes to keep track of that or delegate it.
CRMP offers a pool where you can just throw the inquiry in, keep track of them and generate offers or contracts.


## Properties

- Subject of the inquiry.
- Estimated value.
- Description what the customer wants.
- Date when the inquiry came in.
- Inquiry status.

Reduce everything the customer wants in one sentence and less
to let others in your team quickly see what the topic is.
Make it any phrase shorter than 255 characters.

Estimate the value of the project / inquiry that the customer made,
so that all salesmen can sort them and make decisions based on that estimation.
Treat it as an really vague approximation
or something that is already said to the customer
for a better workflow.
It can be any value with four digits.
This is a mandatory information.

Explain briefly what the customer wants
so that the salesmen or project executive can create an offer.

Keep track of your oldest and youngest inquiries by setting a date,
so that salesmen can establish a workflow to achieve satisfied customers and/or thrifty projects.

The status shows in which step the inquiry is.
It shall be extended via configuration at later time.
For now it only covers some common states.
