# Invoices


Manage invoices in the "/invoice" section.
Invoices keep your business going.
## Deletes an invoice


You should not delete invoices as this is needed for accounting.
Anyways CRMP allows you to delete entities as if they never existed.
Please be careful deleting things.


## Change a single existing invoice


Sometimes a customer should pay more or less for a service
or the invoice needs more details than the contract offered.
In such cases you can edit the invoice.


## Lists all invoices


Control all invoices.
You can apply some filters here to get a better overview.


## Creating a new invoice


Invoices keep your business going especially the paid ones.


## Look at a single invoice


Recheck a single invoice calling "/invoice/{id}".
